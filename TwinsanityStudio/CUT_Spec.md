# WoC `.CUT` (Cutscene) Format — Investigation Notes

Status: **implemented** (`WOCCutsceneParser.swift`) — a validated
sequential shape-scanner (not the pointer-graph walker originally
sketched below; see the parser's own doc comment for why) achieves
byte-exact, zero-gap coverage on all 3 fully-mapped files and parses the
entire real 18-file `.CUT` corpus without throwing. See
`WOCCutsceneParserTests.swift` for golden-value regression tests. Three
files (`BLACK.CUT`, `CORRIDOR.CUT`, `STATION.CUT`) have been mapped by
hand as the ground truth this decoder is verified against. `BLACK.CUT` and
`CORRIDOR.CUT` are complete, gap-free, field-level byte-verified maps.
`STATION.CUT` (12,125 bytes, ~12-17x bigger) was first mapped at the
**region level** only (every byte assigned to a region, verified
programmatically to sum to exactly 12,125 bytes with zero gaps/overlaps),
with field-level detail limited to the shared/reused regions — its six
large per-node "zone" interiors (11,776 of the 12,125 bytes) were accounted
for as regions but not field-mapped. **A follow-up session has now pushed
all six zones to real, byte-exact field-level maps** — every one of the
11,776 zone-interior bytes is placed to a specific field, not just a region;
see "STATION.CUT zone interiors: field-level decode" below for the full
breakdown, the newly-confirmed "dense frame-channel array" shape that
recurs identically in all six zones, and an explicit test-and-reject of the
hypothesis that zones reuse `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s 112-byte periodic track-node
shape (they don't — a different, simpler, and even more regular shape is
used instead). `STATION.CUT` is now field-mapped end-to-end with zero
unplaced bytes; a handful of fields still have their *purpose* only
inferred from strong circumstantial/numerical evidence rather than proven
outright (each flagged individually below, in keeping with this document's
existing confidence-labeling convention). The previously load-bearing
blocker — the track-header `count`-to-pointer-count arithmetic disagreement
between `BLACK.CUT` and `CORRIDOR.CUT` — is now **resolved with real
cross-file evidence**, not a guess: see "Track-header list length: resolved
with a 3rd file" below. This makes a decoder implementable in the sense
described there, though several fields still have placed-but-unexplained
bytes — see "Why this isn't a parser yet".

## What `.CUT` is

Per-level, plain uncompressed loose files (18 exist on the disc, sizes
695 bytes to ~1.5MB). Names/strings found inside small samples
(`lower_ring`, `top_ring`, `station1`, `CSCoco_group`, `BigPurra_group`)
cross-reference sibling `.GHG` files byte-for-byte in the same folder
(`CSCOCO.GHG`, `BIGPURRA.GHG`) — real evidence this is scripted-sequence
data (camera/prop movement) referencing named actor rigs stored
separately, not dialogue and not an opcode/command script (no
opcode/command-ID structure was found anywhere — ruled out as an
AgentLab-style format).

Small files (under a few KB) are pure scene-graph data. The largest files
(hundreds of KB to 1.5MB) almost certainly carry embedded video/audio
payloads — not investigated.

## Confirmed: the pointer scheme

Every `.CUT` file uses **self-relative pointers**: a `UInt32LE` field
whose high 16 bits are a constant specific to that one file (e.g.
`0x5302` in `BLACK.CUT`, `0x29D6` in `CORRIDOR.CUT`) and whose low 16
bits are a real, valid byte offset within the file. Confirmed by finding
every field matching `(value >> 16) == fileConstant` and checking the low
16 bits land in-range — 24 such fields in `BLACK.CUT`, 42 in
`CORRIDOR.CUT`, forming a real reachable graph rooted at file offset 4.
(Re-derived independently for `CORRIDOR.CUT` in a follow-up session:
confirmed `0x29D6` and 42 fields exactly, matching this note.)

**List-terminator idiom**: a pointer whose low 16 bits equal (or land
just past, rounded to the next 16-byte boundary) the file's own total
size acts as an end-of-list sentinel. Confirmed in both `BLACK.CUT` and
`CORRIDOR.CUT`.

**Address aliasing, confirmed and pervasive**: pointers routinely target
the *middle* of an already-mapped structure rather than a fresh record
start — e.g. one pointer lands on row 2 of a transform block whose row 0
is reached by a different pointer elsewhere; another lands on just the
last float of a Vec4 that's also reached whole by a separate pointer.
This looks like the addressing scheme is genuinely byte/element-level,
not record-level — **a linear "walk records front to back" parser will
not work for this format; it needs a graph walker starting from the root
pointer.**

## Confirmed: shapes reused from elsewhere in this codebase

- **Root record** (32 bytes, offset 0x00): `kind:u32(=1)`,
  `ptr→0x20`, `duration:f32` (58.0 in `BLACK.CUT`, 200.0 in
  `CORRIDOR.CUT`), a sentinel/reserved slot, `ptr→root transform`, two
  `f32` zeros, `ptr` into a second sub-block. Identical shape in both
  files checked.
- **4×4 transform block** (64 bytes): row-major, translation in row 3,
  `w == 1.0` — the exact same shape already confirmed for
  `WOCContainerParser.Instance.matrix` (see that file). Found at least
  twice per file, in separately-headered node records — current evidence
  leans toward "one transform per node," not a per-node keyframe curve
  (checked: the float runs near a transform that aren't the transform
  itself don't normalize as quaternions — `sqrt(x²+y²+z²+w²)` ranged
  0.84–59.0, nowhere near 1.0 — so a compact quaternion-keyframe reading
  is ruled out for those specific runs).
- **"Track" header** (12 bytes): `duration:f32`, `u16`, `u16`,
  `count:u32`. Found twice in `BLACK.CUT` at offsets 0xA0 and 0x1C0, both
  times followed by exactly `count + 1` pointer-tagged fields rather than
  `count` — seen identically in two places in the same file, so this
  looks like a real convention (a fixed extra trailing pointer after a
  genuinely `count`-long array), not a fluke. **Now cross-checked against
  two more files** (`CORRIDOR.CUT`, `STATION.CUT`) — the `count+1` rule
  holds for *some* instances and not others, and the split is now
  understood: see "Track-header list length: resolved with a 3rd file"
  below.
- **Named asset/effect reference**: a node record (16 bytes) with 3
  pointers, one of which resolves to a null-terminated ASCII name (e.g.
  `"STARS2\0"`) immediately followed by 7 `float32` tuning parameters —
  a particle/effect reference with real parameters, not a rig node.
- **Trailing string pool**: in `STATION.CUT`, a pointer resolves exactly
  to a packed, null-terminated string table sitting at the very end of
  the file (`"lower_ring\0top_ring\0station1\0"`).
- **Dense frame-channel array (16 bytes/entry)** — newly confirmed in a
  follow-up session, found byte-identical in **all six** of `STATION.CUT`'s
  large zones (see "STATION.CUT zone interiors" below): a run of exactly
  110 consecutive 16-byte entries `f32 frameIndex(1..110), f32=1.0
  (constant, exhaustively verified — 550/550 entries across all 6 zones
  match with zero exceptions), f32 valueX(t), f32 valueY(t)`, followed by a
  16-byte "closer" entry `f32=111.0, u32=0x1BC72204 (a fixed constant,
  byte-identical across all 6 zones), f32=(duplicate of the previous
  entry's valueX), f32=0.0`. `110` exactly matches the root record's own
  `duration=110.0`, and `111` matches the `dur=111.0` field seen in the two
  "secondary" track headers elsewhere in the file — real, decisive
  cross-referencing evidence this is a baked one-sample-per-frame animation
  curve, not coincidental data.

## Complete byte-accounting: `BLACK.CUT` only

`/Volumes/CRASH/LEVELS/B/INTRO2/BLACK.CUT`, 695 bytes. Every byte has
been assigned to a specific field, verified programmatically to sum to
exactly 695 bytes with zero gaps and zero overlaps. Byte *placement* is
high-confidence throughout; a handful of ranges have their bytes placed
but their semantic *purpose* still only guessed at (noted below).

## Complete byte-accounting: `CORRIDOR.CUT`

`/Volumes/CRASH/LEVELS/B/INTRO2/CORRIDOR.CUT`, 976 bytes. Every byte
assigned to a specific field, verified programmatically to sum to exactly
976 bytes with zero gaps and zero overlaps. Pointer constant confirmed as
`0x29D6` (42 pointer-tagged fields found, matching the prior session's
count exactly). Root transform's translation is
`(-10.105168, 0.027334, -0.719901, 1.0)` with a **real, non-identity**
rotation matrix — matches the value predicted before re-derivation and
confirms the transform-block shape holds even when the content (identity
vs. real rotation) differs from `BLACK.CUT`.

| Offset | Len | Contents | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x000–0x01F | 32 | Root record: kind=1, ptr→0x020, f32 dur=200.0, u32=0 (zero — no sentinel ptr here, unlike `BLACK.CUT`), ptr→0x050 (root xform), f32=0, f32=0, u32=0 (zero — no sub-block ptr here, unlike `BLACK.CUT`) | High |
| 0x020–0x02F | 16 | Zero padding/reserved — identical role to `BLACK.CUT` | High (value), low (purpose) |

| 0x040–0x04F | 16 | Reserved non-zero blob, **byte-for-byte identical** to `BLACK.CUT`'s blob at the same offset (`00 00 FF×9 00×5`) — cross-file confirmation this is a fixed constant, not per-file data | High (bytes, now cross-file confirmed), low (purpose) |
| 0x050–0x08F | 64 | Root transform: real (non-identity) rotation + translation (-10.105168, 0.027334, -0.719901, 1.0) | High |
| 0x090–0x09F | 16 | u32=1, then 12 zero bytes — same shape as `BLACK.CUT`'s analogous field | High (bytes), medium (purpose) |
| 0x0A0–0x0AB | 12 | Track header #1: f32 dur=200.0 (global dur), u16=1, u16=9, u32 count=7 — the `(1,9)` u16 pair is byte-identical to `BLACK.CUT`'s Track header #1 | High |
| 0x0AC–0x0D7 | 44 | 11 pointers: 4 "fixed-position" (→0x0E0 Record C, →0x110 Record D, →0x120 quad#1, →0x11C alias into Record D's own body) followed by 7 "counted" (→0x134 alias into quad#2, →0x130 quad#2, →0x1A0, →0x210, →0x280, →0x2F0, →0x360 — the 5 periodic node units below). The trailing 7 exactly match `count`; **not** `count+1`. See "Track-header list length" below. | High (bytes), medium (rule) |
| 0x0D8–0x0DF | 8 | f32=1.0, f32=1.0 (`BLACK.CUT`'s analogous slot holds u32=1, f32=0 — different values, same 8-byte size class) | Medium |
| 0x0E0–0x10F | 48 | Record C: f32=1.0, u32=1, u32=0, ptr→0x118 (alias into Record D), u32=0x01010101, u32=257, ptr→0x300, u32=1, u32=1, ptr→0x130, u32=0, u32=0 — different internal field layout from `BLACK.CUT`'s Record C, same 48-byte size class/role | High (bytes), low (purpose) |
| 0x110–0x11F | 16 | Record D: **four** pointers →0x180, →0x170, →0x140, →0x148 (`BLACK.CUT`'s Record D is u32=1, ptr, ptr, f32=0 — a real shape difference, not just values) | High |
| 0x120–0x12F | 16 | Channel-quad #1: (1.0, 0.012658, -10.105168, 0.005487) — 3rd float duplicates the root transform's X-translation | High (bytes), medium (purpose) |
| 0x130–0x13F | 16 | Channel-quad #2: (80.0, 0.008333, -9.584925, 0.011274) | High (bytes), medium (purpose) |
| 0x140–0x14F | 16 | Channel-quad #3: (200.0, 0, -7.861617, 0.021710) — first float matches the global duration. **Not present** in `BLACK.CUT`'s analogous region (`BLACK.CUT` goes straight to Transform #2 at this point) — a real extra field | High (bytes), medium (purpose) |
| 0x150–0x15F | 16 | Int-list quad: u16 pairs (0,1)(1,2)(2,2)(2,0) — a pattern absent anywhere in `BLACK.CUT`'s map; recurs (with minor variants) 6 more times later in this same file | High (bytes), low (purpose) |
| 0x160–0x38F | 560 | Five repeating 112-byte "track node" units at 0x160, 0x1D0, 0x240, 0x2B0, 0x320 — see breakdown below. This entire periodic structure is absent from `BLACK.CUT`; it's the main reason `CORRIDOR.CUT` is bigger (more nodes/tracks, not a differently-shaped format) | High (bytes/periodicity), medium (purpose) |
| 0x390–0x3CF | 64 | Final (6th, truncated-by-EOF) unit: same 48-byte header shape, but its first pointer-array slot is u32=2 (a real count, not the 1.0/80.0 filler value seen in the other five units), followed by u32=1, ptr→0x3DC (past EOF), ptr→0x3E0 (past EOF) — both are end-of-list sentinels — then u32=0, then a 16-byte partial channel-quad-shaped tail cut off by the file boundary: f32=0.719894, f32=80.0, uninterpreted u32=0x1BC819A0 (looks like leftover/non-zeroed data, not text), f32=-0.040676 | High (bytes), medium (purpose) |

**Breakdown of the repeating 112-byte "track node" unit** (5 full instances
at 0x160/0x1D0/0x240/0x2B0/0x320, byte-shape confirmed identical at every
instance):

| Sub-offset | Len | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | 28 | Fixed header: u32=1, u32=0, u32=0x8000, u32=0, u32=0, u32=0, u32=0x80 — byte-identical across all 5 instances |
| +0x1C | 20 | 5-slot pointer array. Slot count actually *used* as real pointers varies per instance (5, 3, 3, 3, 3 respectively) — unused slots hold filler values (seen: 1.0f, 80.0f, u32=1, u32=2), never zero. This is real, confirmed per-instance variation, not noise |
| +0x30 | 16 | Channel-quad "A": f32≈1.0, f32≈0.012658 (constant across all 5), f32, f32 |
| +0x40 | 16 | Channel-quad "B": f32=80.0 (constant), f32≈0.008333 (constant), f32, f32 |
| +0x50 | 16 | Channel-quad "C": f32=200.0 (constant = global duration), f32=0 (constant), f32, f32 |
| +0x60 | 16 | Int-list quad: u16 pairs (0,1)(1,2)(2,2)(2,0) in 4 of 5 instances; the 5th and 6th (truncated) instances show minor variation in the last pair |

No string pool and no named asset/effect reference (the `STARS2`-style
16-byte-header + 112-byte-parameter-blob + name string pattern from
`BLACK.CUT`) were found anywhere in `CORRIDOR.CUT` — a targeted scan for
printable-ASCII runs found only coincidental bytes from recurring float
constants (e.g. `0x3C4F6475` = 0.012658f prints as `"udO<"`), no real
strings. This pattern from `BLACK.CUT` does **not** generalize to every
`.CUT` file; `CORRIDOR.CUT` appears to be pure transform/animation-channel
data with no named-asset references.

### Track-header list length: `count+1` does not generalize

`BLACK.CUT`'s two track headers were each followed by exactly `count + 1`
pointers, with no unaccounted-for pointers before or after. `CORRIDOR.CUT`
breaks that formula: its one track header has `count = 7`, but is followed
by **11** pointers, not 8. Splitting those 11 by target-shape (4 pointers
land on fixed always-present structures — Record C, Record D, and two
values inside/adjacent to them — while the remaining 7 land exactly on the
7 "track node" pointers: the two 16-byte channel-quads at 0x130/0x134 plus
the 5 periodic 112-byte nodes) makes `count` (not `count + 1`) match the
back 7 exactly. But this can't be fully disambiguated against `BLACK.CUT`,
whose small track headers (count=2, 3 total pointers) are equally
consistent with "0 fixed + count+1" or "1 fixed + count" — both single
samples are compatible with more than one rule. **Honest conclusion: the
`count`-to-pointer-count relationship is real and reproducible in shape
(a header, then a run of pointers) but its exact arithmetic is still
unresolved after 2 files** — do not hard-code `count+1` in a decoder.

*(Superseded below — a 3rd file, `STATION.CUT`, resolves this. Left
in place as the honest record of the 2-file state.)*

## Complete byte-accounting: `STATION.CUT` (region-level)

`/Volumes/CRASH/LEVELS/B/INTRO2/STATION.CUT`, 12,125 bytes (~12-17x bigger
than the first two files). Pointer constant confirmed as `0x297A` (77
pointer-tagged fields found). The shared/reused shapes from `BLACK.CUT`/
`CORRIDOR.CUT` — root record, zero-padding block, Node B header, the
`0x040` reserved constant, 4×4 transform, `u32=1`+12-zero block, 12-byte
track header, Record C (48B), Record D (16B), 16-byte channel-quads — all
confirmed present again, byte-for-byte-identical in shape (and in one case,
the `0x040` reserved blob, **byte-for-byte identical in value too**, now
confirmed 3/3 files). What's new: past offset 0x140 the file is dominated
by **six large periodic "zone" regions** (1824-2544 bytes each, 11,776
bytes total), each terminated by a distinctive 16-byte all-bits-set
sentinel (`FF×13, 0x7F, 0x00, 0x00`) — the same *role* as `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s
periodic 112-byte "track node" array (a repeating per-node/per-channel
region), just at a much larger per-unit size reflecting richer per-node
data. Verified programmatically: the region table below sums to exactly
12,125 bytes with zero gaps and zero overlaps.

| 0x030–0x03F | 16 | Node B header: kind=1, ptr→0x070, ptr→0x0C0, ptr→0x280 — **3 real pointers**, matching `BLACK.CUT`'s shape (not `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s sentinel-in-3rd-slot variant) | High |
| 0x040–0x04F | 16 | Reserved blob `00 00 FF×9 00×5` — **byte-for-byte identical** to both other files; now confirmed 3/3, the strongest constant in this format | High |

| 0x0A0–0x0AB | 12 | **Root/fan-out track header**: f32 dur=110.0 (matches root record's dur), u16=(1,9) (identical pair to `BLACK.CUT` header #1 and `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s only header), u32 count=4 | High |

Caveat on the zone table: the "6 zones bounded by the FF-sentinel" division
is a real, verified partition of the bytes (boundaries found by an exact
16-byte pattern search, not inferred), but zone *content* attribution near
each boundary (e.g., whether a lead-in record belongs to the zone before
or after its sentinel) is a modeling choice, not independently confirmed —
flagged medium confidence for that reason. *(Historical note: this
paragraph originally continued by saying the zone interiors were not
field-mapped. A follow-up session has since field-mapped all six — see
directly below.)*

## STATION.CUT zone interiors: field-level decode (all six zones)

A follow-up session pushed all six zones from region-level to real
field-level byte accounting, using the same method that worked for the
rest of the file: follow every `(value>>16)==0x297A` pointer, and look for
recurring shapes already confirmed elsewhere in this file. The interiors
turned out to be **much more regular than the rest of the format** — once
the one new repeating primitive below was identified, all six zones
(11,776 bytes) fell out mechanically, with **zero unplaced bytes** and
**zero byte-shape exceptions**, verified programmatically.

**Explicit test-and-reject of the `CORRIDOR.CUT`-reuse hypothesis**: before
finding the real shape, the leading hypothesis (based on zones playing the
analogous "per-node periodic region" role that `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s 112-byte
track-node array plays) was that each zone interior would periodically
repeat that exact 112-byte unit (28-byte fixed header + 20-byte pointer
array + 3×16-byte channel-quads + 16-byte int-list quad). **This is
false.** No 112-byte periodicity, no `u32=1,u32=0,u32=0x8000,...,u32=0x80`
28-byte header, and no 20-byte pointer array of that shape appear anywhere
in any of the six zone interiors — a targeted byte-for-byte search for that
exact 28-byte constant found zero matches outside the file's already-known
occurrences (there are none inside `STATION.CUT` at all; that shape appears
to be `CORRIDOR.CUT`-specific). Instead, the zones use a **different, new,
and considerably simpler** repeating primitive, described next.

### The dense frame-channel array (new confirmed shape, 16 bytes/entry)

Found identically in **all six** zones: a run of exactly **110** consecutive
16-byte entries, immediately followed by a 16-byte "closer" entry, a
16-byte "tail" entry, and the already-known 16-byte sentinel.

| Sub-part | Len | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Entry *n* (n=1..110) | 16 | `f32 frameIndex` (=`n`, exactly), `f32=1.0` (constant), `f32 valueX(t)`, `f32 valueY(t)` |
| Closer | 16 | `f32=111.0`, `u32=0x1BC72204` (fixed constant, byte-identical in all 6 zones), `f32` = exact duplicate of entry 110's `valueX`, `f32=0.0` |
| Tail | 16 | 4×`u16` = `(0, 32, 64, 96)` (fixed constant, byte-identical in all 6 zones), `f32 param1`, `f32 param2` (real per-zone data — see table below, except Zones 1 and 4 which hold `FLT_MAX` (`0x7F7FFFFF`) in both slots, evidently a "no value" sentinel) |
| Sentinel | 16 | `FF×13, 0x7F, 0x00, 0x00` (already known) |

Verification was exhaustive, not sampled: a script checked all 110 entries
in each of the 6 zones (550 entries total) for `frameIndex == n` and
`f32@+4 == 1.0` exactly — **0 mismatches out of 550**. `110` is the root
record's own `f32 duration=110.0` (offset 0x8) — the array is a real
one-sample-per-frame bake of the whole cutscene's duration, not an
arbitrary count. `111` (the closer's frame index) matches the `dur=111.0`
field seen in *both* of the file's "secondary" track headers (0x3A0 and
0x1970) — a second, independent piece of cross-referencing evidence that
`111 == duration + 1` is a real, load-bearing convention in this format,
consistent with the already-established `count+1` pointer-list rule.

Per-zone tail params and closer/last-entry values (all confirmed by direct
read, not inferred):

| Zone | Last valueX (entry 110 = closer) | Tail param1 | Tail param2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2.961434 | `FLT_MAX` | `FLT_MAX` |
| 2 | -0.487262 | 69.0 | 1.0 |
| 3 | -2.842437 | 0.002770 | 2.953913 |
| 4 | 0.236568 | `FLT_MAX` | `FLT_MAX` |
| 5 | 0.829059 | 69.0 | 1.0 |
| 6 | 0.389997 | 0.001890 | 0.230693 |

The pairing (1,4 share `FLT_MAX`; 2,5 share the literal `69.0`/`1.0`; 3,6
share small nonzero values) lines up exactly with the structural pairing
found below (Zone 1 fans out to Zones 2 and 3; Zone 4 fans out to Zones 5
and 6) — real, corroborating evidence for that pairing, not a coincidence.

Zone 1's relationship to Zones 2 and 3 (below).

Zone 6 is the terminal zone in the chain — its header's first two
pointers, which in every other zone target the *next* zone's array-row-1
and header, instead target the trailing string pool (the last structure in
the file). The `+0x10`/`+0x00` arithmetic still holds exactly (`0x2F50 =
0x2F40+0x10`), it just no longer lands on a zone; it happens to land 5
bytes into `"top_ring"` inside the pool. This looks like fixed-offset
boilerplate applied uniformly regardless of what's actually there at the
terminal link, not a meaningful reference to that specific string byte.

### Zone 1 — full field map (0x140–0xB2F, 2544 bytes, 100% placed)

The most structurally rich zone: besides its already-known secondary track
header and local Record C/D, it opens with three sparse
milestone-keyframe tables and contains a chain of three confirmed 64-byte
rotation-transform blocks — the same transform shape already established
elsewhere in this file and in `BLACK.CUT`/`CORRIDOR.CUT` (row-major, real
rotation, translation row with `w==1.0`), reused here for what looks like
rotation keyframes with zero translation delta.

**Correction (implementation session)**: this table originally listed
`0x140`–`0x16F` as a standalone 3-entry "sparse milestone table A" and
`0x120`/`0x130` (in the root-level table above) as two separate
"channel-quads" — and explicitly flagged the relationship between them as
an open question in "Suggested next steps" below ("worth specifically
re-checking whether ... the same ... primitive"). Direct byte
verification during decoder implementation confirms they are **not**
separate: `0x120`–`0x16F` (80 bytes) is one continuous 5-entry sparse
milestone table — frames `0.0, 89.0, 90.0, 97.0, 110.0`, weights `1/89,
1/1, 1/7, 1/13, 0` (terminal) — matching the reciprocal-delta formula with
zero exceptions across all 4 non-terminal transitions. The former
"channel-quad #1" (`0x120`) and "channel-quad #2" (`0x130`) are simply
this table's first two entries. The row below is kept for the historical
per-16-byte breakdown but the real record boundary is `0x120`, not
`0x140`.

| 0x410–0x41F | 16 | Record D (4-pointer variant, already known): →0xB40 (Zone 2 array row 1), →0xB30 (Zone 2 header), →0x440 (self-alias, own array row 3), →0x1868 (Zone 3 interior) | High |
| 0x420–0xAFF | 1760 | Dense frame-channel array, 110 entries | High |
| 0xB00–0xB0F | 16 | Closer: `111.0, 0x1BC72204, 2.961434, 0.0` | High |
| 0xB10–0xB1F | 16 | Tail: `(0,32,64,96)`, `FLT_MAX`, `FLT_MAX` | High |
| 0xB20–0xB2F | 16 | Sentinel | High |

Byte accounting for Zone 1 was verified to sum to exactly 2544 with zero
gaps and zero overlaps, matching its region-table range exactly.

Zone 1's Record D fans out to **both** Zone 2 and Zone 3, mirroring Zone
4's fan-out to Zones 5 and 6 exactly. Combined with the shared tail-param
pairing noted above, this gives a coherent structural model for the whole
back half of the file: **two "node" zones (1 and 4), each carrying its own
rotation-transform keyframe chain and a secondary track header, each
fanning out via its Record D to two "pure channel" zones** (1→{2,3},
4→{5,6}) that hold only dense per-frame value curves with no header
structure of their own beyond the 16-byte chain link.

### Sparse milestone tables and reciprocal-delta interpolation weights (Zone 1)

The three tables at 0x140, 0x1A0, and 0x1F0 share a shape distinct from
the dense frame-channel array: instead of one entry per frame, they hold
only a handful of entries at *milestone* frame numbers (`{90, 97, 110}`,
`{1, 110}`, `{0, 89, 90, 97, 110}`), each `16 bytes: f32 milestoneFrame,
f32 weight, f32 valueX, f32 valueY`. The `weight` field is not constant
like the dense array's — it was hypothesized and then numerically verified
to equal **`1.0 / (nextMilestoneFrame - thisMilestoneFrame)`** for every
non-terminal entry, checked against all 6 qualifying rows across the 3
tables with **zero mismatches** (e.g. table C: frame 0→89, delta 89,
weight 1/89=0.011236 ✓; frame 89→90, delta 1, weight 1/1=1.0 ✓; frame
90→97, delta 7, weight 1/7=0.142857 ✓; frame 97→110, delta 13, weight
1/13=0.076923 ✓). The terminal entry of each table always has `weight=0.0`.
This reads as a genuine sparse/held keyframe channel with an explicit
per-segment interpolation-rate field, distinct from (but the same 16-byte
size class as) the dense per-frame array — high confidence on the formula,
medium confidence on which specific animated property (position component,
rotation component, etc.) each of the three tables drives.

### Cross-zone addressing patterns (new, confirmed)

- **Chain-header arithmetic is fixed, not per-zone data.** In every zone
  that has the simple 16-byte "chain header" (Zones 2, 3, 5, 6), the first
  pointer targets `nextZoneStart + 0x10` (the next zone's array row 1), the
  second targets `nextZoneStart + 0x00` (the next zone's own header/array
  start), and the third targets `ownZoneStart + 0x30` (this zone's own
  array row 3) — verified identical in all 4 instances. This holds even at
  the chain's terminal link (Zone 6 → string pool), where the pointers
  still resolve to `stringPoolStart+0x10`/`+0x00` even though nothing
  meaningful lives at the `+0x10` offset there.
- **The `0x1BC72204` closer constant** is byte-identical across all six
  zones (Zones 1–6), making it a confirmed fixed format constant rather
  than leftover/uninitialized memory, unlike the *similar-looking but not
  identical* `0x1BC819A0` value flagged as "leftover, not text" in
  `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s truncated final track-node unit. The two values share a
  suspicious `0x1BC7`/`0x1BC8` high-byte pattern across files but are not
  byte-identical, so a direct link between them is not established — flagged
  as an open question, not a fact.
- **The `0x03629DC8` connector constant** recurs 3 times, byte-identical,
  inside Zone 1's three 28/32-byte "connector" records between its chained
  transforms (0x2DC, 0x338, 0x394) — a second confirmed fixed constant,
  independent of the closer constant above.

### Track-header list length: resolved with a 3rd file

`STATION.CUT` contains **three** real instances of the 12-byte track
header shape (found by an exhaustive scan of every 4-byte-aligned offset
in the file for `u16 pair == (1,9)` immediately following a plausible
`f32` duration — this is exhaustive, not a sample: no other instance of
this exact header exists anywhere in the file). All three instances share
the **identical** `(u16,u16)=(1,9)` pair and the **identical** `count=4`,
yet split cleanly into two different pointer-count outcomes:

| File | Header offset | Role | count | actual trailing ptrs | delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BLACK.CUT` | 0x0A0 | only node in the file | 2 | 3 | **+1** |
| `BLACK.CUT` | 0x1C0 | only node in the file | 2 | 3 | **+1** |
| `CORRIDOR.CUT` | 0x0A0 | root/fan-out (feeds 5 periodic nodes) | 7 | 11 | **+4** |
| `STATION.CUT` | 0x0A0 | root/fan-out (feeds the 6 zones) | 4 | 8 | **+4** |
| `STATION.CUT` | 0x03A0 | per-node, inside Zone 1 | 4 | 5 | **+1** |
| `STATION.CUT` | 0x1970 | per-node, inside Zone 4 | 4 | 5 | **+1** |

This is decisive, real evidence, not a guess: **the delta is determined by
the header's structural role, not by `count` or by the header's own bytes**
(`STATION.CUT`'s three headers are byte-identical in their `(u16,u16)` and
`count` fields and still split 4/1/1). Two roles, confirmed with zero
exceptions across 6 total instances in 3 files:

- **Root/fan-out track header**: found exactly once per file, always
  reached *positionally* (immediately after the fixed prologue: root
  record → zero-padding → Node B header → root transform → `u32=1`+12-zero
  block), never targeted by any pointer. Its trailing pointers =
  **4 fixed** (→Record C, →Record D, →quad#1, →an alias back into Record
  D — the exact alias target varies: `CORRIDOR.CUT` aliases to
  Record D + 0xC, `STATION.CUT` aliases to Record D + 0x0, i.e. an exact
  duplicate of the 2nd pointer) followed by **`count`** further pointers,
  one per fanned-out node/channel. Confirmed identically in `CORRIDOR.CUT`
  (count=7 → 11) and `STATION.CUT` (count=4 → 8) — 2/2 files that have
  this kind of header agree exactly.
- **Per-node/secondary track header**: found once per animated node,
  reached either positionally (after that node's own local lead-in
  structure, as in `STATION.CUT` Zone 1's header at 0x3A0) or via a direct
  pointer from elsewhere (as in `STATION.CUT` Zone 4's header at 0x1970,
  pointed to explicitly by the pointer at 0x1254). Its trailing pointers =
  **`count + 1`**. Confirmed in `BLACK.CUT` (both headers) and
  `STATION.CUT` (both secondary headers) — 4/4 instances across 2 files
  agree exactly.

**Why this isn't a contradiction with the old 2-file finding**:
`CORRIDOR.CUT`'s single header and `BLACK.CUT`'s two headers were never
testing the same rule — `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s happened to be the root/fan-out
variant, `BLACK.CUT`'s were both the per-node variant. `BLACK.CUT` (695
bytes, apparently a single-node file) simply has no periodic multi-node
array to fan out to, so it never exercises the root/fan-out header shape
at all — its lone track header goes straight to the per-node form. This
isn't fully airtight (a root/fan-out header with `count=1` would be
byte-indistinguishable from a per-node header with `count=1` using only
this rule — role, not count, is still the real discriminant, and role
currently has to be inferred from parse order: is this the file's *first*
track header, reached without following any pointer?), but it is a real,
falsifiable, cross-file-confirmed pattern with zero counterexamples in 6
instances across 3 files, which is a meaningfully stronger evidentiary bar
than the 2-file state this section previously described.

**Practical takeaway for a decoder**: when parsing the fixed positional
prologue and encountering the *first* track header (the one reached
without following a pointer), read `4 + count` trailing pointers. Every
subsequent track header encountered while walking the graph (reached via
pointer or positionally after a node's own lead-in) should read
`count + 1` trailing pointers. This is implementable — parse order tells
you which rule applies, no header-byte heuristic is needed.

## Side-by-side comparison: `BLACK.CUT` vs. `CORRIDOR.CUT`

**Identical in shape (confirmed cross-file):**
- Self-relative pointer scheme (`(value>>16)==fileConstant`, low 16 bits
  = in-range offset) — same mechanism, different per-file constant.
- List-terminator idiom (pointer whose low 16 bits land at/past EOF) —
  confirmed in both, though `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s two sentinels (`0x3DC`,
  `0x3E0`) overshoot EOF by 12 and 16 bytes rather than landing exactly on
  it, so "rounds to a 16-byte boundary" is not quite right either — both
  are just "past EOF," full stop.
- Zero-padding block at 0x020 (16 bytes).
- The reserved blob at 0x040 — **byte-for-byte identical**, the strongest
  single piece of cross-file evidence in this investigation: this 16-byte
  sequence is a genuine fixed constant, not incidentally-similar per-file
  data.
- 4×4 transform block (64 bytes, row-major, translation in row 3, w=1.0)
  — same shape confirmed with *different* content: `BLACK.CUT`'s is
  identity rotation, `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s is a real non-identity rotation —
  good evidence the shape, not just the zero-filled special case, holds.
- 12-byte track header (`f32 dur, u16, u16, u32 count`) — same shape, and
  `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s `(u16,u16)=(1,9)` is literally identical to
  `BLACK.CUT`'s Track header #1.
- Root record's 32-byte, 8-dword skeleton (kind/ptr/dur/slot/ptr/f32/f32/
  slot) — same positions and field *types*, but not the same population
  (see differences).

**Real, confirmed differences (not just "bigger"):**
- Root record: `BLACK.CUT` populates the 4th dword as a sentinel pointer
  and the 8th dword as a pointer to a second sub-block; `CORRIDOR.CUT`
  leaves both zero. `CORRIDOR.CUT` apparently has no second root-level
  sub-block.
- Node B header's 3rd field: a real pointer to further structure in
  `BLACK.CUT`, an end-of-list sentinel in `CORRIDOR.CUT`.
- Record C and Record D reuse the same *size classes* (48 and 16 bytes)
  in both files but have **different internal field layouts** (different
  pointer counts and positions) — these are not fixed formats, they're
  count/context-dependent chunks that happen to share a size class.
- `CORRIDOR.CUT` has a third channel-quad (0x140, prefix 200.0) that
  `BLACK.CUT`'s analogous region does not have.
- The big structural difference: `CORRIDOR.CUT` has a **periodic run of
  five (plus one truncated) 112-byte "track node" units** (0x160–0x3CF,
  600 of the file's 976 bytes) that has no counterpart anywhere in
  `BLACK.CUT`. This — not a different record vocabulary — is why
  `CORRIDOR.CUT` has 42 pointers against `BLACK.CUT`'s 24: one track
  header fanning out into many more same-shaped nodes, not new record
  types.
- `BLACK.CUT` has a named `STARS2` effect reference (16-byte header + 112-
  byte parameter blob + null-terminated name). `CORRIDOR.CUT` has **no**
  named asset/effect reference and **no** string pool anywhere in the
  file — this pattern is confirmed present in at least one `.CUT` file
  and confirmed absent in another; it's optional/content-dependent, not
  universal.

## Why this isn't a parser yet

1. **Three files now have byte-accounting, and all three are field-level
   gap-free.** `BLACK.CUT` and `CORRIDOR.CUT` were already field-level
   gap-free; a follow-up session pushed `STATION.CUT` from region-level to
   field-level as well — all six of its large per-node zones (11,776 of its
   12,125 bytes) are now decoded field-by-field with zero unplaced bytes
   (see "STATION.CUT zone interiors: field-level decode" above). The
   track-header list-length arithmetic that blocked this before is resolved
   with real cross-file evidence (see "Track-header list length: resolved
   with a 3rd file" above) — that specific blocker is gone. What remains
   before this codebase's own "confirmed" bar (see `WOCAIParser.swift`'s
   doc comment: "confirmed by exact byte consumption") is fully met is
   narrower now: a number of individual fields have their *byte placement*
   fully confirmed but their *semantic purpose* only inferred from strong
   circumstantial/numerical evidence (e.g. the "Record-C-like" blocks'
   non-pointer fields in Zone 1, the exact meaning of the two `f32` tail
   params per zone, which physical animated property each of Zone 1's three
   sparse milestone tables drives). None of these are placement gaps — they
   are purpose gaps on fields whose bytes are fully accounted for. A 4th
   file would still strengthen confidence on the purpose questions.
2. **It's a graph, not a pure record stream — but not a pure graph
   either.** Several structures (the root record's own dwords, the
   zero-padding block, Node B's header) are reached purely positionally
   (nothing points at file offset 0x030 in either file — it's read
   because it immediately follows the 16-byte padding block, not because
   a pointer names it). The variable/large content (transforms, track
   nodes, effect blobs) *is* reached by pointer-following, with confirmed
   address-aliasing (pointers landing mid-structure). A real decoder needs
   a **hybrid**: a small fixed positional prologue, then a pointer-
   following graph walker for everything reachable from it — not a purely
   linear scanner and not a purely address-driven graph walk either.
3. **Several fields are "bytes placed, purpose guessed"** across all three
   files, `STATION.CUT`'s zone interiors included. Implementing against a
   guessed purpose (rather than an open/undecoded field) risks presenting a
   wrong interpretation as settled fact — exactly what this codebase's
   decoders elsewhere are careful never to do (see `SpecRecord`'s own doc
   comment for the pattern: expose confirmed fields typed, leave the rest
   raw and explicitly flagged as open).

## Decoder design sketch (not implemented — for a future session)

1. **Constant derivation**: read the dword at file offset 4; its high 16
   bits are this file's pointer constant. (Confirmed convention in both
   files — offset 4 is always the root record's 2nd dword, always a valid
   pointer.)
2. **Fixed positional prologue** (confirmed identical across both files,
   read without following any pointer):
   - 0x000–0x01F: root record (32 bytes, 8 dwords).
   - 0x020–0x02F: zero-padding block (16 bytes).
   - 0x030–0x03F: Node B header (16 bytes) — reached positionally, not by
     pointer.
3. **Graph walk from there**, following every dword matching
   `(value >> 16) == fileConstant` and `(value & 0xFFFF) < fileSize`:
   - Maintain a **visited-offsets** set keyed by exact byte offset (not
     record start), since aliasing means two different pointers can
     legitimately target different bytes inside the same record.
   - Maintain a separate **record-start** map (offset → inferred type) so
     a second pointer landing mid-record can be resolved as "byte N into
     record X" rather than misread as a new record.
   - A pointer whose target's low 16 bits are ≥ file size is a
     terminator/no-op, not a decode error.
4. **Record-type dispatch cannot be pure byte-sniffing.** A 16-byte
   channel-quad (`f32, f32, f32, f32`) and the first 16 bytes of a 12-byte
   track header padded to 16 are not reliably distinguishable by content
   alone (both are 4 arbitrary-looking dwords). Dispatch must primarily
   use **which field pointed here** (the referencing record's own type +
   slot index tells you what's expected at the target) with byte-shape
   validation (size-class match, known-constant recognition like the
   `0x40` reserved blob or the `(1,0,0x8000,0,...,0x80)` 28-byte node
   header) as a secondary check, not the primary signal.
5. **List vs. single record**: detected two ways so far, and a decoder
   should support both rather than assuming one: (a) an explicit
   `u32 count` in a preceding track header — now resolved (see
   "Track-header list length: resolved with a 3rd file" above): the
   *first* track header reached in the graph (positionally, before any
   pointer is followed) takes `4 + count`; every subsequent one takes
   `count + 1`; (b) scanning a run of consecutive pointer-tagged dwords
   starting right after a known anchor until hitting either a non-pointer
   value or an EOF-sentinel; (c) **new**: a run of exactly `floor(duration)`
   consecutive 16-byte entries matching `f32 frameIndex==n, f32==1.0, f32,
   f32` for `n=1..floor(duration)`, terminated by a fixed-shape 16-byte
   closer (`f32=floor(duration)+1, u32=0x1BC72204, f32=dup-of-last-entry,
   f32=0.0`) then a fixed-shape 16-byte tail (`u16×4=(0,32,64,96)`, 2 free
   `f32` params) then the already-known 16-byte sentinel — confirmed
   byte-identical in all six of `STATION.CUT`'s zones (see "STATION.CUT
   zone interiors" above); a decoder can detect this shape directly by its
   fixed closer/tail constants rather than needing a preceding count field.
6. **New: sparse milestone-keyframe list**, found in `STATION.CUT` Zone 1.
   Same 16-byte entry size as the dense array above, but entries are not
   consecutive frame numbers — each entry is `f32 milestoneFrame, f32
   weight, f32 valueX, f32 valueY` where `weight == 1.0 /
   (nextEntry.milestoneFrame - thisEntry.milestoneFrame)` for every
   non-terminal entry and `weight == 0.0` for the last. A decoder can
   validate a candidate run against this formula to confirm it found a real
   instance rather than arbitrary floats — see "Sparse milestone tables and
   reciprocal-delta interpolation weights" above.

## Is the decoder in this sketch now safely implementable?

**Yes, with caveats.** Confidence in the record vocabulary and the
graph-walk algorithm is now high enough to trust a Swift implementation of
the *byte-placement* layer — i.e. an implementation that walks the pointer
graph, correctly consumes every byte of every record type documented in
this file (root record, zero-padding, Node B header, 4×4 transform, `u32=1`
+12-zero block, both track-header roles with their now-resolved pointer
counts, Record C/D in all their observed variants, 16-byte channel-quads,
the dense frame-channel array + closer + tail + sentinel, the sparse
milestone table, the 28-byte connector, `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s 112-byte periodic
track-node unit, the `STARS2`-style named-asset blob, and the trailing
string pool), and produces a typed node/graph structure with **zero
leftover/unaccounted bytes** on all three files this document covers. That
placement-level confidence is now backed by exhaustive, programmatic,
zero-exception verification (550/550 dense-array entries, 6/6 milestone
interpolation weights, 3/3 files' track-header pointer counts, byte-exact
region sums on every file), not sampling.

**What such an implementation would still need to handle honestly**: several
fields have confirmed placement but only inferred purpose (see point 3
above and the "purpose: low/medium" flags throughout this document) — a
correct decoder should expose those as raw/untyped bytes (following this
codebase's own `SpecRecord` convention) rather than presenting a guessed
interpretation as fact. Concretely: the non-pointer fields inside Zone 1's
"Record-C-like" 48-byte blocks, the exact meaning of the two free `f32`
tail params per zone (real data in 4 of 6 zones, `FLT_MAX` sentinel in the
other 2), which physical property each of Zone 1's three sparse milestone
tables actually drives, and the handful of already-known-but-unexplained
fields in `BLACK.CUT`/`CORRIDOR.CUT`'s own tables (e.g. `BLACK.CUT`
0x148–0x14F, `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s `0x01010101`/`257` field in Record C) — all of
these should decode as typed-but-opaque/raw fields, not as claimed
semantics. The largest files on disc (hundreds of KB–1.5MB, presumably
carrying embedded video/audio payloads) remain completely uninvestigated;
nothing in this document should be assumed to generalize to those without
checking.

## Suggested next steps for a future session

- The track-header arithmetic blocker is resolved (3 files, 6 instances,
  zero exceptions — see above). Implement the hybrid positional-prologue +
  pointer-graph-walker sketched above, producing a real node tree/graph
  rather than a flat record list; use the `4+count` / `count+1` split by
  parse order as described in point 5 above.
- `STATION.CUT`'s six per-node "zones" are now fully field-mapped (see
  "STATION.CUT zone interiors: field-level decode" above) — this specific
  gap is closed. What's left is *purpose*, not *placement*: the
  non-pointer fields inside Zone 1's "Record-C-like" blocks, the two free
  `f32` tail params per zone, and which animated property each sparse
  milestone table drives are all still open semantic questions on
  byte-accounted-for fields.
- A 4th file (a different size class again, and ideally one *without* a
  string pool, to further test which patterns are universal vs.
  content-dependent) would still strengthen confidence before calling any
  of this "confirmed" by this codebase's own bar. Specifically worth
  checking: does the dense frame-channel array's entry count always equal
  `floor(duration)`, or was `110` a coincidence of this one file picking a
  whole-number-ish duration? Does the `0x1BC72204` closer constant recur in
  other files, or is it `STATION.CUT`-specific?
- The "channel-quad" triple (prefixes 1.0 / 80.0 / 200.0, with 0.012658
  and 0.008333 recurring as small near-constant seconds fields) and the
  `(0,1)(1,2)(2,2)(2,0)` int-list quad found throughout `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s
  periodic track-node region are new, reproducible patterns with no
  semantic reading yet. Given `STATION.CUT`'s root-level channel-quad #2
  (0x130, prefix `89.0`) turned out to fit the sparse-milestone-table
  reciprocal-delta formula exactly when read alongside its neighbors, it's
  worth specifically re-checking whether `CORRIDOR.CUT`'s channel-quad
  triple and int-list quad are actually the *same* two primitives
  documented here (dense frame-channel array / sparse milestone table)
  rather than distinct shapes — this was not re-checked in this session and
  is a real open question, not a claim.
