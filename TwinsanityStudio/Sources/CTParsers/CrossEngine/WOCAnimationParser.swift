/// `formatFlag` is `3` in 8 of the 10 files (no trailer) and `4` in
/// exactly 2 (`DROID.ANM`, `TOONARMY.ANM` -- both carry the trailing
/// `Vector3`).
///
/// **History**: this format was originally confirmed only on the 4
/// `formatFlag == 3` files sampled first, with a 5th real file,
/// `TOONARMY.ANM` (1128 bytes, 20 top-level entries with Maya-derived
/// names like `"pcube2318"`), flagged as diverging after its first entry
/// -- read at the time as evidence that real skeletal-animation files
/// use a materially different, more complex per-joint curve encoding.
/// A full disc-wide sweep of all 10 real `.ANM` files found the true
/// cause instead: `TOONARMY.ANM` (and `DROID.ANM`, which happened not to
/// be in the original 4-file sample) both carry one extra trailing
/// `Vector3` per top-level entry, gated by `formatFlag == 4` -- once that
/// field is accounted for, ALL 10 real files decode with exact
/// byte-consumption, `TOONARMY.ANM` included. Its "joint-like" names read
/// as Maya object/debris names (it lives in the `TSUNAMI` level
/// directory) with a spawn/pivot `Vector3` and zero sub-effects, not
/// skeleton joints. **No genuine per-joint keyframe/curve skeletal
/// animation format has been found in any real `.ANM` file on this
/// disc** -- if WoC stores real character/creature skeletal animation
/// data at all, it is not in these loose files (a plausible next place
/// to look: `CHARS.DAT`, unexamined as of this writing). `parse` still
/// throws rather than silently returning garbage if byte-consumption
/// doesn't land exactly on end-of-file, so a genuinely different format
/// showing up in a future file remains detectable rather than silently
/// misdecoded.
