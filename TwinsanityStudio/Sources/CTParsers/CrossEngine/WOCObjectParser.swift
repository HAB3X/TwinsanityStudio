/// `schemaVersion` is a strict step function of the file's own export
/// date (`11`→`12`→`13` across the corpus, zero exceptions, independent
/// of content -- an export-tool/schema stamp, not per-level data).
/// `recCount` -- the number of trailing 32-byte `Placement` records for
/// this object -- is `paramBlock`'s own field index 5 (0-indexed,
/// relative byte offset 20), confirmed to exactly match the real
/// trailing record count on every object checked. `paramBlock`'s other 8
/// fields are mostly undecoded; two have plausible-but-unproven roles (a
/// small positive float that might be a bounding/interaction radius, and
/// a float that's `0` for simple actuators but a real type-specific
/// value like a stroke distance for others) -- not exposed as typed
/// fields for that reason, `paramBlock` is exposed raw instead.
///
/// **Every real object has a non-empty tail after its placements --
/// never zero bytes, minimum 12.** An earlier version of this parser
/// assumed a *possibly-empty* tail and stopped decoding the moment the
/// next 16 bytes didn't look like the next object's name, which meant it
/// only ever recovered the file's first object (its own tail bytes never
/// looked like a name) -- silently wrong on every one of the 16 real
/// files checked. Real tail sizes observed across the full corpus: `12,
/// 24, 60, 64, 96, 100, 144, 220` bytes. The tail's *contents* are
/// genuinely per-instance, not per-object-type: 25 of 68 distinct object
/// names show more than one real tail size across their own instances
/// (`piston` alone shows 4 distinct sizes) -- so tail length is driven by
/// something in this specific placement (plausibly one of `paramBlock`'s
/// still-undecoded fields), not a fixed per-type schema. A `name ==
/// "piston"` dispatch table would therefore be unsafe even if the tail's
/// internal layout were fully decoded.
///
/// Two real tail shapes ARE understood at the framing level (not
/// exposed as typed data below, since the per-instance-length problem
/// above means a caller can't reliably tell which shape applies without
/// re-deriving it): a plain `N=12`/`24` numeric trailer (one or two
/// zero-filled `Vector3` triples), and a `12 + 36*k + 12`-byte shape
/// (`k >= 1`) of named actuator-state sub-blocks (`name:Bytes(16)
/// reserved:UInt32(==0) params:Float32x4` each, 36 bytes -- e.g.
/// `hammer_02` carries `"HammerDown"`/`"HammerUp"`). Sub-block names are
/// shared/reused actuator-state labels, not tied to the owning object's
/// own name (`"HammerDown"`/`"HammerUp"` also appear on `squash_01` and
/// `piston`) -- exposed raw here rather than guessed at.
///
/// Given the tail can't be safely skipped by assuming its shape,
/// ``parseObjects(_:)`` locates each next object by scanning forward
/// (4-byte-aligned) from the end of the current object's placements for
/// the next byte offset where a real object header re-validates (a
/// name-shaped 16 bytes, immediately followed 52 bytes later by the
/// confirmed `0xFFFFFFFF` sentinel, with a plausible `recCount`) --
/// analogous to `WOCContainerParser.walkOBJ0Chunks`'s own marker-based
/// resync after an unpredictable-length region. Validated against the
/// full corpus: 373 of 373 real declared objects across all 16 real
/// files recover this way, zero failures, zero false-positive resyncs.
