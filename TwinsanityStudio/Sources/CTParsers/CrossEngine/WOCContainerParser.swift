/// Decoder for the top-level container format inside decompressed WoC
/// `.GSC` level files (post-`RNCDecompressor`). This is a brand-new format
/// with no existing reference implementation anywhere in this repo's
/// reference material -- unlike `RNCDecompressor`, every field here was
/// derived by hand from real decompressed bytes (7 real WoC level files
/// spanning very different sizes and areas) and cross-checked for
/// consistency before being treated as confirmed. Fields not yet
/// consistency-checked across multiple real files are called out as such
/// in their doc comments rather than presented as certain.
///
/// **Confirmed file layout** (verified: the section chain below walks every
/// one of the 7 sample files to exactly 100% of its decompressed byte
/// length, with no gaps and no out-of-bounds reads):
/// ```
/// File    := "NU20" negatedByteCount:UInt32LE formatVersion:UInt32LE reserved:UInt32LE Section*
/// Section := tag:ASCII(4) length:UInt32LE payload:Bytes(length - 8)
/// ```
/// - `negatedByteCount`: confirmed by exact arithmetic match across all 7
///   samples to be `(0x1_0000_0000 - totalDecompressedByteCount) mod 2^32`
///   -- i.e. the two's-complement negation of the file's own total decoded
///   size. Purpose unconfirmed (plausibly a cheap self-description a loader
///   checks against the buffer it allocated), but the arithmetic identity
///   itself is exact, not approximate.
/// - `formatVersion`/`reserved`: constant `6` and `0` in all 7 samples.
///   Too few data points to be fully sure these never vary, but there is
///   no evidence yet that they do.
/// - `Section.length` is **relative to the section's own tag position**,
///   not an absolute file offset and not a payload-only length -- it is
///   the exact byte distance from this section's tag start to the next
///   section's tag start (or, for the last section, to end of file).
///   Confirmed identically for both the small top-level sections (`NTBL`)
///   and the largest one (`TST0`, hundreds of KB) via direct byte
///   inspection at the predicted offset.
///
/// **Section tags seen across the 7 samples, in the order they appear**
/// (not confirmed to be exhaustive or always in this exact order -- this is
/// what 7 files showed): `NTBL`, `TST0`, `MS00`, `TAS0` (present in some
/// files, absent in others -- e.g. missing from `AIRSHIP.GSC`/`FARM.GSC`,
/// present in `HUB.GSC`/`CASTLE_C.GSC`), `OBJ0`, `INST`, `IABL`/`ALIB`
/// (also present-in-some/absent-in-others), `SPEC`, `SST0` (always last).
///
/// **Decoded so far** (this list has grown across several sessions --
/// including a real self-correction, see `INST` below, from a broad
/// 54-file sweep that overturned an earlier 2-file-verified claim):
/// - `NTBL` (name table) -- see ``parseNameTable(_:)``. Fully decoded: a
///   byte-length-prefixed blob of null-terminated names. The trailer bytes
///   between the name blob and the next section are not understood (their
///   length varies non-trivially and doesn't reduce to a formula from the
///   name list alone).
/// - `MS00` -- see ``parseMeshSet(_:)``. Confirmed to be `count` fixed
///   464-byte records (exact division verified universally across the
///   full 54-file corpus, zero exceptions). Record internals not decoded.
///   **Naming correction (see "Corrections from decompiled reference
///   source" below): the real handler is `ReadMaterialSet`, not a mesh
///   reader.** `MS00` is the file's *material* table (`gscene->mtls`),
///   referenced by index from `OBJ0` geometry entries and `TAS0` -- the
///   `parseMeshSet`/`MeshSetRecord` names in this codebase are now known
///   to be mislabeled. Left unrenamed pending disc re-verification (the
///   464-byte framing itself isn't contradicted by this finding, only the
///   name); a future pass should rename the Swift symbols to
///   `parseMaterialSet`/`MaterialSetRecord`.
/// - `IABL` -- see ``parseAttributeBlock(_:)``. Same framing, confirmed
///   fixed 96-byte records across all 24 files in the full corpus that
///   have it, zero exceptions. Sibling `ALIB` was explicitly tested and
///   ruled out as fixed-width (different widths per file).
///   **Naming correction: the real handler is `ReadInstAnim`** (source's
///   own comment: "Dunno about the name, it was commented as
///   INSTANIMBLOCK") -- i.e. **Instance Animation**, not "Attribute
///   Block". Its real C framing (`count:UInt32LE reserved:UInt32LE` then
///   the record blob, with per-instance assignment driven by an
///   `instances[i].anim != NULL` marker set elsewhere) matches this
///   codebase's confirmed byte framing exactly. Left unrenamed pending a
///   confirmation pass on `AttributeBlockRecord`'s internal field names.
/// - `INST` (placed object instances) -- see ``parseInstances(_:)`` and
///   ``Instance``. The 80-byte records are real 4x4 world transforms
///   (`w == 1.0` universally, translations plot into recognizable real
///   level layouts, e.g. `CASTLE_C.GSC`'s cross-shaped corridor). The
///   tail's first field is a confirmed reference into `OBJ0` (see
///   ``Instance/objectIndex`` for the full story, including a real
///   correction after an initial 2-file check accidentally verified the
///   wrong property).
/// - `SPEC` -- see ``parseSpecRecords(_:)`` and ``SpecRecord``. Same
///   80-byte record shape as `INST`, but a curated, strictly-increasing
///   pointer-list *into* `INST` -- each record's matrix is byte-identical
///   to the `INST` record it references. Perfectly confirmed at full
///   corpus scale: 1461 total `SPEC` records across all 46 files in the
///   54-file corpus that have both `SPEC` and `INST`, zero
///   not-strictly-increasing indices, zero out-of-bounds references, zero
///   matrix mismatches -- not "almost always", zero exceptions of any
///   kind.
/// - `TST0` -- see ``parseTextureEntry(_:trailerOffset:)`` and
///   ``scanTextureEntries(_:)``. Not a record table at all: a serialized
///   PS2 Graphics Synthesizer texture-upload command stream. The per-entry
///   size/width/height math was re-checked across the full 54-file corpus
///   (1110 total validated entries, ZERO dimension-formula failures) --
///   but the entry-boundary *scan* is a documented heuristic, not a
///   complete parser: it finds zero entries at all in 4 of the 54 files
///   (their `TST0` apparently uses the unpadded variant first seen in
///   `E3HUB.GSC` -- see that function's doc comment for the follow-up on
///   what is and isn't understood about that variant).
/// - `SST0` (always the last section) -- see ``parseFooterHeader(_:)``.
///   Outer shape confirmed (`A:u32` + `B:u32` blob-length + blob + small
///   trailer). The trailer-echoes-own-section-length pattern, re-checked
///   across the full 54-file corpus: present in exactly 10 of 53 files
///   with `SST0`, and every single time it's present it's an exact match
///   (zero false positives) -- real and deliberate, but only a minority
///   shape; most files' `SST0` trailers look different or are absent.
///   Blob internals unresolved.
///   **Naming correction: the real handler is `ReadSplineSet`** -- i.e.
///   `SST0` is a **Spline Set**, not an unnamed footer blob. This
///   independently corroborates the `nugspline_s`/`NuSplineFind` findings
///   from the new `.VIS`/camera-path work (``WOCCameraPathParser``): WoC
///   splines (named point paths, used for both camera rails and
///   visibility-culling regions) are very likely stored here at the
///   `.GSC` level. The blob's internal framing is not yet re-derived from
///   this correction -- worth revisiting once disc access resumes,
///   ideally cross-referencing this section's blob shape against
///   `WOCCameraPathParser`'s still-raw `body` field, since both may
///   ultimately decode to the same `nuvec_s`-strided point-list shape.
/// - `ALIB` -- see ``parseAttributeLibrary(_:)``. NOT a fixed-width table
///   (confirmed dead end from an earlier pass); the real structure is a
///   `count`-entry offset table (relative to just past the table itself,
///   with `0` as an empty-record sentinel) into a following record blob.
///   Verified across all 25 files that have it, and independently
///   cross-validated against `IABL`'s own `alibIndex` field (see
///   ``AttributeBlockRecord/alibIndex``): every `IABL` record references
///   a valid `ALIB` index, and in 8 of 24 files the exact set of
///   `ALIB`-indices-never-referenced-by-`IABL` matches the exact set of
///   `ALIB`'s own empty-sentinel records. Record *internals* (once
///   boundaries are known) are still undecoded.
///   **Naming correction: the real handler is `ReadAnimationLibrary`**
///   (not "Attribute Library" as this codebase's own guess had it). More
///   importantly, the real in-memory shape it builds is a genuine
///   **skeletal animation curve tree**: each `ALIB` entry is a
///   self-relative pointer (same aliasing scheme confirmed in `.CUT`) to
///   a `nuanimdata_s` struct, which fans out through `chunks[]` →
///   `animcurvesets[]` (one per animated node) → `curves[]` →
///   `animkeys`. This lines up structurally with this codebase's own
///   confirmed `count:UInt32LE reserved:UInt32LE(==0)
///   offsetTable:UInt32LE[count] recordBlob:Bytes` framing -- the offset
///   table is very likely exactly this self-relative pointer array, and
///   `recordBlob` is very likely the nested chunk/curveset/curve/animkey
///   data itself. This is the single most promising unexplored lead for
///   the still-unsolved "how are skeletal animation curves actually
///   encoded" question (see also `CHARS.DAT`'s own still-undecoded
///   per-clip motion blobs, in ``WOCCharacterAnimationCatalogParser``).
///   **Update, same follow-up session**: a separate reference file,
///   `code/src/nu3dx/nuanim.c`/`.h` (not the `GHG_GSC_FUNCTIONS.txt` file
///   this section's other corrections came from), contains WoC's actual
///   on-disk animation-curve *reader* (`NuAnimDataRead`), not just
///   pointer-relocation logic -- a complete, concrete, byte-exact
///   candidate layout for `nuanimdata_s`/`nuanimdatachunk_s`/
///   `nuanimcurveset_s`/`nuanimcurve_s`/`nuanimkey_s`, plus a documented
///   compressed/quantized variant. See
///   ``WOCCharacterAnimationCatalogParser``'s doc comment for the full
///   byte-sequence sketch -- written up there since it's a stronger match
///   for `CHARS.DAT`'s clip blobs than for this section, but it's the
///   same underlying format either way. Still not checked against a
///   single real byte of either `ALIB`'s own record blob or a
///   `CHARS.DAT` clip.
/// - `OBJ0` -- **entry boundaries now fully solved** by
///   ``parseObjSet(_:materialCount:)``, which implements the real
///   `ReadObjSet` sequential algorithm found in decompiled reference
///   source rather than heuristic marker-scanning: exact byte-consumption
///   and exact declared-entry-count match across all 58 real files
///   checked, zero exceptions, INCLUDING `CASTLE_C.GSC`/`HUB.GSC` (now
///   1113/1113 and 700/700 -- previously only 8/1113 and 27/700 via the
///   older `walkOBJ0Chunks(_:)` marker-walk, which is retained
///   unmodified since production mesh rendering (`WOCMeshDecoder`) still
///   depends on it -- see ``parseObjSet(_:materialCount:)``'s own doc
///   comment for the migration question this raises). Each entry's real
///   embedded mesh geometry (tristream/dmastream byte ranges, matching
///   the already-confirmed 16-byte vertex quadword pattern -- see
///   ``parseVertexQuadwords(_:byteOffset:count:)``) is exposed per
///   `ObjSetGeoEntry`/`ObjSetFaceonEntry`, still raw since which of the
///   two payload shapes applies depends on `MS00` material attributes not
///   yet decoded.
/// - `TAS0` -- see ``parseTextureAssignments(_:)``. Present in 12 of 54
///   files. An earlier investigation guessed a 44/48/96/112-byte record
///   width from a plain division and called it inconsistent; the real
///   record is a fixed 32 bytes, confirmed by exact byte-accounting
///   (zero exceptions) across all 12 files. This is the first confirmed
///   texture/mesh-binding data found in the format: a trailing `UInt16`
///   list whose every value is a valid index into that same file's own
///   decoded texture list (``scanTextureEntries(_:)``), and the
///   per-entry-to-texture-index mapping is now confirmed exactly (each
///   entry's own `frameStartIndex`/`frameCount` fields slice out its real
///   sub-run -- see ``TextureAssignmentEntry`` and ``frames(for:)``,
///   zero exceptions across all 7 locally-checked real files).
///   **Naming correction, and a real open question it raises**: the real
///   handler (referenced, not defined, in the decompiled source -- its
///   dispatch-table comment is even mislabeled `// MS00`, a copy-paste
///   typo) is `ReadTexAnimSet` -- i.e. `TAS0` is a **Texture Animation
///   Set**, not a static texture/material assignment table as this
///   codebase's own name/doc previously assumed. This raises a real,
///   currently-unverified possibility: the per-entry `UInt16` texture
///   index lists this codebase already decodes may be animated-texture
///   **frame sequences** (a UV/texture-swap flipbook) rather than a
///   static binding, which would also explain why `STATION.GSC`'s entries
///   were observed to have unequal index-list group sizes (a natural
///   consequence of different animations having different frame counts,
///   not an anomaly). **Update, re-verified against real bytes**: this
///   frame-sequence reading is now well-supported, not just plausible --
///   see ``TextureAssignmentEntry/frameStartIndex``'s doc comment for the
///   exact per-entry grouping evidence (contiguous ascending runs, shared
///   identical runs between entries) found once disc access resumed.
///
/// Every section not listed above as decoded is exposed as raw
/// ``WOCSection/payload`` bytes rather than guessed at.
///
/// **Corrections from decompiled reference source (added post-hoc, not
/// re-verified against real bytes)**: a later session found
/// `Games Files/Reference Files/OpenCrashWOC-main`, a partially
/// decompiled/reconstructed WoC source tree (match-confidence annotated,
/// e.g. `//MATCH`, `//98%`) that includes `NuGScnLoadFix`, the real
/// section-tag dispatch switch this whole format was reverse-engineered
/// without ever having seen -- `PS2_Version/GHG_GSC_FUNCTIONS.txt`. It
/// confirms every section tag's real name and, for several, real C-level
/// field framing that lines up closely with (and in some cases directly
/// confirms) what this file already found by hand: `INST` is read as
/// `count:UInt32LE reserved:UInt32LE` then `count` fixed-size instance
/// structs (exactly this codebase's own confirmed `INST` framing); `NTBL`
/// is `byteLength:UInt32LE` then that many raw bytes, lowercased in place
/// (exactly this codebase's own confirmed `NTBL` framing); `SPEC` is read
/// as `count:UInt32LE reserved:UInt32LE` then `count` records **of the
/// same struct width as `INST`**, each carrying an instance index and a
/// name-table byte offset (independently corroborates this codebase's own
/// "`SPEC` reuses `INST`'s 80-byte shape" finding, from the opposite
/// direction); `TST0` is read per-entry as `size:UInt32LE offset:UInt32LE`
/// with a same-shape/different-framing branch when `offset == 0` (broadly
/// consistent with, though not byte-identical to, this codebase's own
/// `TST0` heuristic scan -- worth a direct line-up once disc access
/// resumes). Per-tag naming/semantic corrections are noted inline next to
/// each affected tag above (`MS00`, `IABL`, `ALIB`, `SST0`, `TAS0`); none
/// of them have been re-verified against real bytes yet, since
/// `/Volumes/CRASH` was unmounted when this was written -- treat every
/// correction above as "real evidence, pending byte-level confirmation",
/// not yet promoted to this file's own "Confirmed" bar.
