/// Decoder for WoC `.VIS` files -- and the one real `.POO` file
/// (`WEST_A.POO`), confirmed to be the exact same format under a
/// different extension (same header shape, same `weecam_*` string
/// vocabulary). Despite the `.VIS` extension, **this is not a
/// visibility/PVS system** -- an earlier survey's "per-instance
/// visibility bitfield" hypothesis is directly ruled out (the payload is
/// float/coordinate-typed, not boolean-packed) and superseded by real
/// evidence of what it actually is.
///
/// **CONFIRMED, high confidence**: every real file (14 `.VIS` + 1
/// `.POO`, zero exceptions) ends in a packed, null-terminated ASCII
/// string table whose real entries are literal named camera path
/// entry points -- `weecam_mid_00`, `weecam_in_bonus`,
/// `weecam_out_bonus`, `weecam_mid_bonus`, `weecam_mid_death`,
/// `weecam_in_death`, `weecam_in_gem`, `weecam_mid_gem`,
/// `weecam_right_bonus` -- "weecam" being WoC's small/cutscene camera.
/// This is real, named **cinematic camera path data**: bonus-round,
/// gem, and death-respawn camera sequences per level, not a spatial
/// visibility system.
/// ```
/// File := sentinel:UInt32LE(==0xFFFFFFFF) nodeCount:UInt32LE headerB:UInt32LE
///         body:Bytes(...)   -- a node/path graph, see below
///         stringCount:UInt32LE
///         String(stringCount)   -- null-terminated ASCII, packed, ends exactly at EOF
/// ```
/// The string table's own leading count is located unambiguously:
/// scanning for the offset where reading that many consecutive
/// null-terminated printable-ASCII strings lands EXACTLY on end-of-file
/// -- verified to find exactly one such offset in all 15 real files,
/// with the real camera-path names as a result (a naive backward scan
/// for "the last run of printable-or-null bytes" is genuinely ambiguous
/// here, since a small count's own zero-padding bytes are
/// indistinguishable from string null-terminators; this scan-forward
/// exact-EOF-landing approach avoids that ambiguity entirely).
///
/// **CONFIRMED, the body's real node/path graph is now fully decoded**
/// (a follow-up session solved what this doc originally left open):
/// `headerB` is specifically **node 0's own point count** -- not a
/// generic file-level count, which is why treating it as one had been
/// ruled out. The body decodes as:
/// ```
/// body := Node0Points(headerB * 12 bytes, Vec3 each)
///         Node(nodeCount - 1) {           -- for nodes 1..<nodeCount
///           pointCount:UInt32LE
///           Points(pointCount * 12 bytes, Vec3 each)
///         }
///         indexTable: nodeCount:UInt32LE
///                     IndexRecord(nodeCount)  -- 16 bytes each
/// IndexRecord := nameIndex:Int32LE selfIndex:Int32LE fieldC:Int32LE fieldD:Int32LE
/// ```
/// Each `Vec3` is a real world-space point (cross-referenced against
/// that same level's `INST` coordinate range and confirmed to fall in
/// the same envelope). Verified with exact, zero-slack byte accounting
/// on **14 of the 15 real `.VIS`/`.POO` files on the mounted disc**: the
/// point-list walk consumes exactly `body.count - (4 + nodeCount*16)`
/// bytes, landing precisely on the index table's own leading
/// `nodeCount` echo, on every file except `TOONARMY.VIS` (see below).
///
/// `IndexRecord.nameIndex` is the field that actually matters: **always
/// a valid index into `cameraPathNames`, zero exceptions across all 5
/// files spot-checked at the record level** (`CASTLE`/`CASTLE_C`/
/// `DROID`/`VOLCANO`/`GARDEN`) -- this is how multiple physical point-
/// list nodes share one logical named path (e.g. `CASTLE.VIS` has 9
/// nodes but only 6 names; nodes 0-3 all share name index 0, i.e. one
/// multi-segment path built from 4 separate point lists). `selfIndex`
/// usually equals the node's own position in the list, but **not
/// always** -- on `VOLCANO.VIS`, nodes that share a `nameIndex` in pairs
/// sometimes cross-reference each other's index instead of their own
/// (node 18 -> 19, node 19 -> 18), suggesting a paired/linked role
/// rather than a plain self-index; not fully understood, exposed raw.
/// `fieldC`/`fieldD` are real but their meaning isn't decoded.
///
/// **`TOONARMY.VIS` is the one real exception**: its point-list walk
/// still succeeds cleanly (15 plausible node lengths, `ok`), but the
/// trailing bytes don't land exactly on `4 + nodeCount*16` (`228` real
/// bytes left vs. `244` expected) -- consistent with this doc's
/// already-known "doesn't fit the uniform 16-byte-per-node index-record
/// width other files do" finding. Rather than guess at that file's index
/// table, ``File/nodes`` still gets real, correct points for every node
/// on `TOONARMY.VIS`, just with `nameIndex == nil` throughout (see
/// ``CameraPathNode``) -- an honest partial result, not silently wrong
