/// Haven: Call of the King, the early LEGO games, or Crash Nitro Kart. Their
/// chunk layouts, record formats, and endianness conventions would all have
/// to be reverse-engineered from scratch — this repository has no verified
/// reference source for any of them (compare `twinsanity-editor-master`,
/// which *is* a verified reference for Twinsanity itself, and is what every
/// parser in `CTParsers` is grounded in). A driver stubbed out against
/// guessed offsets wouldn't be "multi-engine support" — it would silently
/// misparse or crash on real files while claiming to work. When a real
/// reference (community documentation, a decompiled binary, another OSS
/// tool) surfaces for one of those engines, it gets its own
/// `EngineDriver` conformance next to this one; until then, this stays a
