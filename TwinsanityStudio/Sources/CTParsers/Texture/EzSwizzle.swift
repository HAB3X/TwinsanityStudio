/// PS2 Graphics Synthesizer local-memory block-swizzle simulator, ported from
/// `Twinsanity/EzSwizzle.cs`. The PS2 GS never stores texture data as a plain
/// row-major buffer — it addresses a simulated 4 MiB local memory in
/// hardware-defined 32x32(ish) "page/block/column" tiles whose layout differs
/// per pixel format (PSMCT32, PSMT8, ...). To decode a texture you have to:
/// 1. Write the on-disk bytes into simulated GS memory using the *source*
///    format's addressing (`writeTexPSMCT32` — Twinsanity always transfers
///    swizzled texture data as raw PSMCT32 words over the bus).
/// 2. Read it back out using the *target* format's addressing
///    (`readTexPSMT8`) — the actual un-swizzle happens purely as a side effect
///    of the two addressing functions disagreeing about where a given (x, y)
///    texel lives.
///
/// Only the PSMCT32 and PSMT8 address tables are ported — those are the only
/// two formats `Texture.Load` in the original tool ever fully decodes;
/// everything else falls back to a raw-bytes passthrough there too (see
/// `TextureParser`).
