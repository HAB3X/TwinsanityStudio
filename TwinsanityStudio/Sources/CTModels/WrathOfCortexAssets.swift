/// trusted, not just adopted from source: `WESTERN.CRT` (86 groups, 211
/// crates) and `VOLCANO.CRT` (real second sample) both decode with **zero
/// leftover bytes** (the whole file consumes exactly) and **zero
/// implausible values** (every position finite and in-range) end to end.
/// Real structural corroboration beyond just "it parses": every group's
/// own `origin` exactly equals its first crate's own `position` (the
/// natural relationship for an anchor point), multi-crate groups show
/// small, sensible position deltas between consecutive crates (real
/// stacking/placement patterns), and adjacency (`neighborUp`/`Down`/etc)
