/// (not thrown away) purely so `MaterialWriter` can reproduce a shader block
/// byte-for-byte after `name`/`textureId` are edited, without inventing
/// values for any of the fields this codebase hasn't decoded. Editing
/// `shaderType` here is unsupported: the captured bytes were only ever
/// validated against the original `shaderType`'s parameter-block length.
