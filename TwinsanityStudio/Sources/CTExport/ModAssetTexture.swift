/// This is deliberately **not** an attempt at the real on-disk PS2 GS
/// texture record format (`TextureParser`/`TextureWriter`'s own PSMCT32/
/// PSMT8 layout — GS block-swizzling, CLUT palette, a header carrying
/// fields like `textureBufferWidth`/`clutBufferBasePointer`). Building one
/// of those requires the *target* record's own original header bytes
/// (`TextureWriter`'s private `fixedHeaderFields(of:)`), which simply don't
/// exist for a texture that's only ever lived as a decoded, in-memory
/// `TextureAsset` — e.g. a real Wrath of Cortex texture, already decoded by
/// `WOCTextureDecoder` from an entirely different engine's own on-disk
/// format before it ever reaches this file (see `ResolvedModelAsset.
/// applyingTextureOverride`'s own doc comment for the "Cross-Engine Texture
/// Variant" feature this exists to support). CrateModLoader's own real
/// precedent for a bundled external-resource asset
/// (`CrateModAPI/ModProperties/ModProp_TextureFile.cs`) doesn't store a raw
/// GS record either — it hands the *decoded* `Bitmap` to `ResourceToFile`,
/// which saves a `.png`; this format follows that same "store the decoded
/// image, not a target-specific on-disk record" idea, just as a flat custom
/// container instead of PNG (a lossless straight-RGBA round trip needs no
/// compression, and every field `TextureAsset` actually carries — including
/// its own `pixelFormat` label — round-trips exactly, which a plain PNG
/// wouldn't preserve on its own).
///
/// Layout (all multi-byte fields little-endian, via `BinaryWriter`/
/// `BinaryCursor` — same convention every other binary format in this
/// codebase uses):
/// ```
/// "TSTX"             4 bytes  magic
/// version            1 byte   currently 1
/// width              4 bytes  UInt32

/// base level a submesh actually samples for preview/install, and
/// `applyingTextureOverride` itself never touches mips either.
