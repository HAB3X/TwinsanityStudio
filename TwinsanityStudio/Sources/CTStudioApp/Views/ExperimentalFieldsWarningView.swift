import SwiftUI

/// A one-time onboarding note for every screen that shows `ConfidenceTag`-marked
/// fields (the short "(experimental, unconfirmed)"-style parenthetical tags —
/// see `ConfidenceTag.swift`'s own doc comment for the full vocabulary and its
/// real call sites: `ModelViewerWindow`, `LodModelInspectorView`,
/// `WorldPlacementInspectorViews` (Instance/Trigger/Camera inspectors, shown
/// both from the sidebar's `InspectorView` and from the Level Viewer's own
/// selection inspector), `CollisionSurfaceEditorSheet`, `GameObjectEditorSheet`).
///
/// Deliberately a dismissible banner, not an `.alert`/sheet — unlike
/// `DanglingReferenceChecker`'s confirmation (which gates an irreversible
/// disk write), this is background context the user should see once, not a
/// decision that should block interaction with the rest of the screen.
///
/// Scope: **once per install**, not once per view. All call sites bind the
/// same `@AppStorage` key below, so dismissing it on any one screen (Level
/// Viewer, Model Viewer, sidebar Inspector, etc) dismisses it everywhere —
/// it's the same underlying caveat repeated at every `ConfidenceTag` site,
/// not a separate warning per screen, and re-showing it screen-by-screen
/// would just be nagging. If a future call site wants its own independent
/// dismissal, give it its own key rather than changing this one's meaning.
