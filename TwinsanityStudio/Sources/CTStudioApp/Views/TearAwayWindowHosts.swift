/// "Tear-Away Workspaces" (roadmap 9.5): the Hex Viewer and Mod Crate Hub
/// as real `Window` scenes (see `CTStudioApp`) instead of `.sheet()`s —
/// floating, independently movable across monitors, and usable alongside
/// every other panel rather than blocking the main window while open.
///
/// A different motivation from `GPUViewerWindowHosts.swift`'s three
/// viewers (which moved to `Window` to sidestep a suspected sheet/
/// `CAMetalLayer` compositing quirk): these two have no GPU content and no
/// bug to work around. They're picked specifically because neither
/// navigates elsewhere on selection the way the asset-browsing hubs
/// (Models/Textures/Levels/Sound Banks Hub) do — e.g. `ModelsHubView`
/// dismisses itself and opens the Model Viewer when you tap a card, which
/// is the right behavior for a sheet but would defeat the point of a
/// tear-away window (stay open, keep working). Converting those hubs the
/// same way would mean revisiting that dismiss-on-select behavior first;
/// out of scope here, so they stay sheets for now.
