/// "Forge Palette anywhere" — the user's own ask: "I want the thumbnail to
/// load in the forge palette even if the level is not loaded." Before this,
/// the Forge Palette only ever resolved a real thumbnail for an object ID
/// through three sources: the currently open level's own `assetIndex`, the
/// shared `Default.rm2` fallback, and whatever some *other* level already
/// resolved this session (`WorkspaceViewModel.globalObjectThumbnails`). An
/// object whose only real geometry lives in a level nobody has opened yet
/// showed a permanent placeholder cube even though the disc almost
/// certainly has it somewhere.
///
/// This class owns exactly the state a palette row needs to show an honest
/// in-between state while that search runs: which object IDs are currently
/// being searched, and which have been confirmed to resolve nowhere on this
/// disc (so "still checking" is never visually indistinguishable from
/// "checked everywhere, genuinely nothing" — a real, explicit requirement).
/// The actual search logic — enumerating every mounted archive's `.rm2`/
/// `.rmx` entries, parsing each one's own `GraphicsAssetIndex` (cached, never
/// re-parsed), and racing a handful of concurrent lanes through the
/// candidate list — lives on `WorkspaceViewModel.
/// resolvingObjectIDAcrossAllLevels(_:)`, which already owns every other
/// piece of archive-reading/caching state (`archiveIndexByRootID`,
/// `sharedDefaultAssetIndexTask`, `globalObjectThumbnails`) this needed to
/// reuse. This class is purely the orchestration/UI-facing half: "have I
/// already started (or finished) looking for this one?"
///
/// Owned the same way `SceneryLoadCache` is: a `@State` on
/// `LevelViewerWindow` (this class is `@Observable`, not a legacy
/// `ObservableObject`, so `@State` — not `@StateObject` — is the correct
/// owner, same reasoning as `SceneryLoadCache`'s own doc comment), so it
/// survives switching `editorMode` away from the Forge Palette tab and back
/// without losing in-flight/confirmed search state.
