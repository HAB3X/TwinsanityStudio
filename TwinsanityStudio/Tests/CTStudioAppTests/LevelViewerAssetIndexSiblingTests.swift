/// Regression test for a real, previously-silent bug: `LevelViewerContext.
/// assetIndex` (what the Forge Palette and already-placed Instance markers
/// resolve `GameObject`/`Instance.objectID` through) was built from the
/// *scenery* node's own file root — always the `.sm2` side, since
/// `openLevelViewer` is "always entered from the scenery side" — but real
/// `GameObject` records structurally live in the sibling `.rm2` actor file
/// (`hubb.sm2` carries zero of its own, `hubb.rm2` carries 32, confirmed
/// against the real archive). Every level's own objects were invisible to
/// this resolver; only the shared `Default.rm2` fallback ever worked,
/// which is why most Forge Palette entries — and even some already-placed
/// actors — fell back to an amber placeholder cube instead of real
/// geometry. Skips gracefully when the local disc image isn't present.
