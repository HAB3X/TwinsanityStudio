/// The strongest real-data check yet for `SceneryModelPlacement.worldTransform`'s
/// rotation correctness. Every other regression in this area
/// (`SceneryModelPlacementTransformTests`, `CoordinateSystemRegressionTests`)
/// checks a placement's *position* only — a placement's origin point can sit
/// in exactly the right spot while its mesh is still oriented wrong, which
/// would show up visually as "pieces don't connect at their edges" without
/// tripping a position-only check.
///
/// This finds real, structural (not decorative-clutter) tile pairs in
/// `beach.sm2` — the same model reused at grid-spaced positions with a
/// genuinely different (90°) rotation between two neighbors — resolves their
/// *actual mesh geometry*, transforms every vertex through the real
/// placement transform, and checks the two meshes' nearest vertices land
/// within floating-point noise of each other, not a multi-unit gap. A wrong
/// rotation formula (even one that reproduces the reference tool's matrix
/// bit-for-bit in isolation but has a sign/handedness error) would show up
/// here as a real, multi-unit gap or overlap — the same class of check that
/// caught the original "transpose" bug, just applied to orientation instead
/// of position.
