/// "Chunk Stitching Rendering Bug": real investigation found stitching a
/// linked chunk only ever gathered that neighbor's `SceneryData`
/// placements — its own `Instance`/`Trigger`/`Camera`/`AIPosition` records
/// (living in the neighbor's sibling `.rm2`, exactly like the *primary*
/// chunk's own actor data) were never loaded at all. This is what a user
/// stitching a chunk actually experiences as "only objects render, not
/// terrain" — inverted: what they see post-stitch is the *primary*
/// chunk's own pre-existing objects, since the neighbor's own never
/// arrive. `WorkspaceViewModel.loadChunkLinkActors` +
/// `LevelViewerRenderer.stitchChunkActors` are the fix.
